# CLI Reference

nrdocs has two CLI tools:

- **`nrdocs` binary** — standalone CLI for bootstrap token onboarding (`nrdocs init --token`)
- **`nrdocs.sh` script** — admin operations wrapper for the Control Plane API

## nrdocs binary (bootstrap onboarding)

The standalone `nrdocs` CLI handles end-to-end onboarding for developers with a bootstrap token.

### init

Onboard a repository using a bootstrap token. Runs a 6-phase flow: preflight checks, token validation, interactive prompting, file scaffolding, remote project creation + token minting, and CI secret installation.

```bash
nrdocs init --token <bootstrap-token>
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--token <token>` | yes | Bootstrap token issued by your organization admin |
| `--slug <value>` | no | Project slug (for non-interactive use) |
| `--title <value>` | no | Project title (for non-interactive use) |
| `--repo-identity <value>` | no | Repository identity in format `github.com/owner/repo` (for non-interactive use) |
| `--docs-dir <value>` | no | Documentation directory (default: `docs`) |
| `--description <value>` | no | Project description |

In interactive mode, the CLI infers values from the git remote and prompts for confirmation. In non-interactive mode (piped stdin), `--slug`, `--title`, and `--repo-identity` are required.

**What it does:**

1. Verifies you're in a git repo and the token is a valid bootstrap token
2. Validates the token against the control plane, displays org name and remaining quota
3. Infers repo identity, slug, and title from the git remote; prompts for confirmation
4. Generates `project.yml`, `nav.yml`, `content/home.md`, and `.github/workflows/publish-docs.yml`
5. Creates the project on the control plane and mints a repo publish token
6. Installs `NRDOCS_PUBLISH_TOKEN` (secret) and `NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID` (variable) via `gh` CLI

If `gh` is not installed or not authenticated, the CLI prints the exact `gh secret set` / `gh variable set` commands to run manually.

**Generated workflow:** The generated `publish-docs.yml` uses repo publish token auth (`NRDOCS_PUBLISH_TOKEN`) with `X-Repo-Identity` header binding — not the admin API key. The API URL is embedded directly in the workflow file.

## nrdocs.sh script (admin operations)

The `nrdocs.sh` CLI (`scripts/nrdocs.sh`) is a local management tool that wraps the Control Plane API. Instead of manually constructing curl commands with JSON payloads, you run short commands like `./scripts/nrdocs.sh publish`.

## Prerequisites

- `bash` (included on macOS and Linux)
- `curl` (included on most systems)
- `jq` (JSON processor) — install from [jqlang.github.io/jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/)
- A deployed Control Plane Worker (see [Installation](../installation/index.html))

## Setup

### 1. Create your .env file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Fill in the values

Open `.env` in your editor:

```
NRDOCS_API_URL=https://nrdocs-control-plane.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev
NRDOCS_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID=
NRDOCS_DOCS_DIR=docs
```

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `NRDOCS_API_URL` | yes | The URL of your deployed Control Plane Worker. Wrangler prints this when you run `wrangler deploy --env control-plane`. |
| `NRDOCS_API_KEY` | yes | The admin API key you generated during installation and set via `wrangler secret put API_KEY`. This is not a Cloudflare-provided key — it's a secret you created yourself. |
| `NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID` | after register | The project UUID. Leave empty initially — you'll get it from the `register` command output. |
| `NRDOCS_DOCS_DIR` | no | Path to your docs directory relative to the project root. Defaults to `docs`. |

The `.env` file is gitignored — your secrets stay local.

## Commands

### init

Registers a new project and approves it in one step. A shortcut for running `register` then `approve`.

```bash
./scripts/nrdocs.sh init
```

Reads from: `.env` (API_URL, API_KEY), `docs/project.yml` (slug, title, access_mode).

If `NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID` is not set in `.env`, the command registers the project and prints the new ID, then asks you to add it to `.env` before running `approve` separately.

If `NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID` is already set, it registers and approves in sequence.

### register

Registers a new project with the Control Plane. The project starts in `awaiting_approval` status.

```bash
./scripts/nrdocs.sh register
```

Reads from:
- `.env` — `NRDOCS_API_URL`, `NRDOCS_API_KEY`
- `docs/project.yml` — `slug`, `title`, `description`, `access_mode`

The command parses your `project.yml` and sends a registration request to the Control Plane. On success, it prints the new project UUID:

```
Registering project: nrdocs
Success (201)
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "slug": "nrdocs",
  "status": "awaiting_approval",
  ...
}

Project ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
Add this to your .env file:
  NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID=550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

Copy the ID into your `.env` file. You need it for all subsequent commands.

### approve

Approves a registered project, transitioning it from `awaiting_approval` to `approved`. Only approved projects can accept publishes and serve content.

```bash
./scripts/nrdocs.sh approve
```

Reads from: `.env` — `NRDOCS_API_URL`, `NRDOCS_API_KEY`, `NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID`.

### publish

Reads all files from your docs directory, packages them into a JSON payload, and sends it to the Control Plane's publish endpoint. The Control Plane then builds the HTML and uploads it to R2.

```bash
./scripts/nrdocs.sh publish
```

Reads from:
- `.env` — `NRDOCS_API_URL`, `NRDOCS_API_KEY`, `NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID`, `NRDOCS_DOCS_DIR`
- `docs/project.yml` — sent as-is to the Control Plane
- `docs/nav.yml` — sent as-is to the Control Plane
- `docs/allowed-list.yml` — sent if present, otherwise null
- `docs/content/**/*.md` — every Markdown file is read and included in the payload

The command:
1. Validates that `project.yml`, `nav.yml`, and `content/` exist in the docs directory
2. Reads all files and constructs the JSON payload
3. POSTs it to `$NRDOCS_API_URL/projects/$NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID/publish`
4. Prints the result (success with publish ID, or failure with error details)

The project must be in `approved` status. If it's still `awaiting_approval` or has been `disabled`, the publish will be rejected.

### status

Fetches and displays the current project details from the Control Plane.

```bash
./scripts/nrdocs.sh status
```

Reads from: `.env` — `NRDOCS_API_URL`, `NRDOCS_API_KEY`, `NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID`.

### disable

Disables a project. Disabled projects return 404 to all readers and reject publish requests. All data (D1 records, R2 artifacts) is preserved — you can re-approve the project later.

```bash
./scripts/nrdocs.sh disable
```

Reads from: `.env` — `NRDOCS_API_URL`, `NRDOCS_API_KEY`, `NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID`.

### delete

Permanently deletes a project and all associated data: D1 records, R2 artifacts, and access configuration. This cannot be undone.

```bash
./scripts/nrdocs.sh delete
```

Reads from: `.env` — `NRDOCS_API_URL`, `NRDOCS_API_KEY`, `NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID`.

Prompts for confirmation before proceeding:

```
Are you sure you want to delete project 550e8400-...? This removes all data. [y/N]
```

### help

Shows the usage summary and all available commands.

```bash
./scripts/nrdocs.sh help
```

## Typical workflow

### First time

```bash
# 1. Set up your .env
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set NRDOCS_API_URL and NRDOCS_API_KEY

# 2. Register the project
./scripts/nrdocs.sh register
# Copy the project ID into .env

# 3. Approve it
./scripts/nrdocs.sh approve

# 4. Publish
./scripts/nrdocs.sh publish
```

### Subsequent publishes

After the initial setup, publishing is a single command:

```bash
./scripts/nrdocs.sh publish
```

Edit your Markdown files, run publish, and the live site updates.

### Using npm

You can also run the CLI through npm:

```bash
npm run nrdocs -- publish
npm run nrdocs -- status
npm run nrdocs -- help
```

## Error messages

| `project.yml not found` | The docs directory doesn't have a `project.yml` | Check `NRDOCS_DOCS_DIR` in `.env` and make sure the file exists |
| `Failed (409)` on register | A project with that slug already exists | Use a different slug in `project.yml`, or delete the existing project first |
