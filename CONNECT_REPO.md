# How to Connect a Repository to nrdocs

This document is an instruction guide for LLM agents. It describes the exact steps to set up a repository for publishing documentation through the nrdocs platform.

## Context

nrdocs is a documentation publishing platform. It takes Markdown files from a repository, builds them into an HTML site with sidebar navigation and in-page TOC, and serves them at a URL like `https://docs.example.com/<slug>/`.

The user has a running nrdocs platform (two Cloudflare Workers deployed). They want to connect a repository so its documentation is published automatically on push to `main`.

There are two onboarding paths:

- **Bootstrap token onboarding** (recommended) — the user has a bootstrap token from their org admin. The `nrdocs init` CLI handles everything automatically.
- **Admin API onboarding** — the user is a platform operator with the admin API key. They register and approve the project manually.

## Path A: Bootstrap Token Onboarding (recommended)

If the user has a bootstrap token, this is the fastest path. The `nrdocs` CLI handles project creation, file scaffolding, token minting, and CI secret installation in one command.

### What you need from the user

| Value | What it is | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Bootstrap token | An org-scoped JWT issued by an admin | `eyJhbGciOi...` |

That's it. Everything else is inferred or prompted interactively.

### Run the init command

```bash
nrdocs init --token <bootstrap-token>
```

The CLI will:
1. Validate the token against the control plane
2. Detect the git remote and infer repo identity, slug, and title
3. Prompt the user to confirm or override each value
4. Generate `project.yml`, `nav.yml`, `content/home.md`, and `.github/workflows/publish-docs.yml`
5. Create the project on the control plane and mint a repo publish token
6. Install `NRDOCS_PUBLISH_TOKEN` (secret) and `NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID` (variable) via `gh` CLI

For non-interactive use (CI, scripts):

```bash
nrdocs init --token <token> --slug my-project --title "My Project" --repo-identity github.com/org/repo --docs-dir docs --description "My docs"
```

### After init

The user just needs to:
1. Review the generated files
2. Commit: `git add -A && git commit -m "Initialize nrdocs"`
3. Push to main: `git push origin main`

The GitHub Actions workflow triggers automatically and publishes the docs.

### Generated workflow differences

The bootstrap-generated workflow uses **repo publish tokens** (not admin API keys):
- `secrets.NRDOCS_PUBLISH_TOKEN` — a single-repo, single-project credential
- `vars.NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID` — a repository variable (not a secret)
- `X-Repo-Identity: github.com/${{ github.repository }}` header for repo binding
- The API URL is embedded directly in the workflow file (not a secret)

## Path B: Admin API Onboarding

This is the original onboarding path for platform operators with the admin API key.

### What you need from the user

Before starting, ask the user for these values. They come from the nrdocs platform installation:

| Value | What it is | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `NRDOCS_API_URL` | URL of the Control Plane Worker | `https://nrdocs-control-plane.example.workers.dev` |
| `NRDOCS_API_KEY` | Admin API key (set during nrdocs installation) | `0553c09...` (64-char hex string) |
| `slug` | URL path segment for this project (lowercase, hyphens, unique) | `my-project` |
| `title` | Display title for the sidebar header | `My Project Docs` |
| `access_mode` | `public` (open) or `password` (requires login) | `public` |
| `docs_dir` | Where docs live in the repo (default: repo root `.`) | `docs` or `.` |

If the user doesn't know the API URL or key, they can find them in the `.env` file of their nrdocs installation.

## Step 1: Create the docs file structure

Create these files in the repository. If `docs_dir` is `.` (repo root), create them at the root. If `docs_dir` is `docs`, create them under `docs/`.

### project.yml

```yaml
slug: <slug>
title: "<title>"
description: "<one-line description>"
publish_enabled: true
access_mode: <access_mode>
```

All fields are required. The `slug` must be unique across all projects on the platform and will be used in the URL.

### nav.yml

This defines the sidebar navigation. Every page must be listed here. nrdocs does NOT auto-discover pages from the filesystem.

```yaml
nav:
  - label: "Getting Started"
    path: getting-started
  - label: "Guides"
    section: true
    children:
      - label: "Installation"
        path: guides/installation
      - label: "Usage"
        path: guides/usage
  - label: "API Reference"
    path: api-reference
```

Rules:
- Leaf items have `label` and `path`. The `path` maps to `content/<path>.md`.
- Section items have `label`, `section: true`, and a `children` array.
- Every `path` must have a corresponding `.md` file under `content/`.
- The `label` is used as the page title in the browser tab.

### content/ directory

Create a `content/` directory with Markdown files matching the paths in `nav.yml`.

Pages are plain Markdown — no frontmatter required:

```markdown
# Getting Started

Your content here. Supports **bold**, `code`, lists, tables, code blocks, etc.

## Section heading

h2 and h3 headings automatically appear in the "On this page" TOC on the right.
```

The file `content/getting-started.md` corresponds to `path: getting-started` in nav.yml.
The file `content/guides/installation.md` corresponds to `path: guides/installation`.

### Example structure

```
<docs_dir>/
├── project.yml
├── nav.yml
└── content/
    ├── getting-started.md
    ├── guides/
    │   ├── installation.md
    │   └── usage.md
    └── api-reference.md
```

## Step 2: Copy the GitHub Actions workflow

Copy the file `templates/publish-docs.yml` from the nrdocs repository into the target repository at `.github/workflows/publish-docs.yml`:

```
<repo>/
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── publish-docs.yml
```

The content of this file is:

```yaml
name: Publish Docs to nrdocs

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  publish:
    name: Publish documentation
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build payload and publish
        env:
          NRDOCS_API_URL: ${{ secrets.NRDOCS_API_URL }}
          NRDOCS_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.NRDOCS_API_KEY }}
          NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID }}
          NRDOCS_DOCS_DIR: ${{ vars.NRDOCS_DOCS_DIR || '.' }}
        run: |
          set -euo pipefail
          DOCS_DIR="${NRDOCS_DOCS_DIR:-.}"
          if [ -z "${NRDOCS_API_URL:-}" ]; then echo "::error::NRDOCS_API_URL secret is not set"; exit 1; fi
          if [ -z "${NRDOCS_API_KEY:-}" ]; then echo "::error::NRDOCS_API_KEY secret is not set"; exit 1; fi
          if [ -z "${NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID:-}" ]; then echo "::error::NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID secret is not set"; exit 1; fi
          project_yml=$(jq -Rs '.' < "$DOCS_DIR/project.yml")
          nav_yml=$(jq -Rs '.' < "$DOCS_DIR/nav.yml")
          if [ -f "$DOCS_DIR/allowed-list.yml" ]; then allowed_list_yml=$(jq -Rs '.' < "$DOCS_DIR/allowed-list.yml"); else allowed_list_yml="null"; fi
          pages_json=$(jq -n '{}')
          while IFS= read -r -d '' file; do
            relative="${file#"$DOCS_DIR/content/"}"
            key="${relative%.md}"
            page_content=$(jq -Rs '.' < "$file")
            pages_json=$(echo "$pages_json" | jq --arg k "$key" --argjson v "$page_content" '. + {($k): $v}')
          done < <(find "$DOCS_DIR/content" -name '*.md' -type f -print0 | sort -z)
          payload=$(jq -n --argjson project_yml "$project_yml" --argjson nav_yml "$nav_yml" --argjson allowed_list_yml "$allowed_list_yml" --argjson pages "$pages_json" '{repo_content: {project_yml: $project_yml, nav_yml: $nav_yml, allowed_list_yml: $allowed_list_yml, pages: $pages}}')
          http_code=$(curl -s -o response.json -w '%{http_code}' -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${NRDOCS_API_KEY}" -d "$payload" "${NRDOCS_API_URL}/projects/${NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID}/publish")
          echo "Response status: ${http_code}"
          cat response.json
          if [ "$http_code" -lt 200 ] || [ "$http_code" -ge 300 ]; then echo "::error::Publish failed with HTTP ${http_code}"; exit 1; fi
          echo "Publish succeeded."
```

## Step 3: Register the project with the Control Plane

This step requires the nrdocs CLI or a direct API call. The project must be registered and approved before publishing works.

### Option A: Using the nrdocs CLI (if available)

If the user has the nrdocs repo cloned with the CLI set up:

```bash
NRDOCS_DOCS_DIR=<docs_dir> ./scripts/nrdocs.sh register
# Copy the project ID from the output
NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID=<id> ./scripts/nrdocs.sh approve
```

### Option B: Using curl

```bash
# Register
curl -X POST "$NRDOCS_API_URL/projects" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NRDOCS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "slug": "<slug>",
    "repo_url": "https://github.com/<org>/<repo>",
    "title": "<title>",
    "description": "<description>",
    "access_mode": "<access_mode>"
  }'

# Response includes "id" — save it as PROJECT_ID

# Approve
curl -X POST "$NRDOCS_API_URL/projects/$PROJECT_ID/approve" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NRDOCS_API_KEY"
```

### For password-protected projects

If `access_mode` is `password`, also set the password:

```bash
curl -X POST "$NRDOCS_API_URL/projects/$PROJECT_ID/password" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NRDOCS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"password": "<password>"}'
```

## Step 4: Configure GitHub repository secrets

Tell the user to go to their GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions, and add:

| Type | Name | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Secret | `NRDOCS_API_URL` | The Control Plane Worker URL |
| Secret | `NRDOCS_API_KEY` | The admin API key |
| Secret | `NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID` | The project UUID from Step 3 |

If docs are in a subdirectory (not repo root), also add a **variable** (not secret):

| Type | Name | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Variable | `NRDOCS_DOCS_DIR` | Path to docs dir, e.g. `docs` |

## Step 5: Push and verify

After all files are created and secrets are configured, push to `main`. The GitHub Actions workflow will trigger and publish the docs.

The site will be available at: `https://<delivery-worker-domain>/<slug>/`

## Checklist

Before telling the user it's done, verify:

- [ ] `project.yml` exists with correct slug, title, access_mode
- [ ] `nav.yml` exists with at least one page
- [ ] Every `path` in `nav.yml` has a corresponding `content/<path>.md` file
- [ ] `.github/workflows/publish-docs.yml` exists
- [ ] Project is registered and approved via the Control Plane API
- [ ] GitHub repository secrets are configured (NRDOCS_API_URL, NRDOCS_API_KEY, NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID)
- [ ] If docs are in a subdirectory, NRDOCS_DOCS_DIR variable is set

## Common errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Slug mismatch` | `slug` in project.yml doesn't match the registered slug | Make them identical |
| `nav.yml references pages that do not exist` | A `path` in nav.yml has no matching `.md` file | Create the missing file or fix the path |
| `Cannot publish project with status 'awaiting_approval'` | Project wasn't approved | Run the approve API call |
| `A project with slug "X" already exists` | Slug is taken | Choose a different slug |
| `Publish failed with HTTP 401` | Wrong or missing API key in GitHub secrets | Check NRDOCS_API_KEY secret |
| `Publish failed with HTTP 404` | Wrong project ID in GitHub secrets | Check NRDOCS_PROJECT_ID secret |
